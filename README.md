Uniqki: A Personal Wiki Builder http://uniqki.isnew.info

Uniqki is a simple yet powerful Perl script that can build a website with static HTML files. Its name originated from Unique Wiki. There are two types of pages including non-wiki and wiki pages. Only admins can create or edit non-wiki pages while visitors or non-admin users can contriute their contents to wiki pages depending on write access control settings. The key difference between the two types of pages is that non-wiki pages can embed Perl code in page source while wiki pages cannot.

Uniqki can be used to create a private and closed website using the web server's rewrite rules. Since HTML files are generated by the script and directly served by the web server, it's the server's responsibility to secure those files and redirect requests to the script.
